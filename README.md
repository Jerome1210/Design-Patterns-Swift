# Design-Patterns-Swift

This is a design pattern practice project by reference the book [JAVA Design Patterns](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/design_pattern_tutorial.pdf). It is a chance to be familiar with Swift 3 but also a good path to be a better engineer even an architecture(I'm so greedy..). The plan is to implement an design pattern once a day. Hope I can make this challenge! That's go!!
